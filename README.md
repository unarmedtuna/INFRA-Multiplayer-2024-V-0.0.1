# INFRA-Multiplayer-2024-V-0.0.1
110% experimental, extract zip and place INFRA Multiplayer Folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods
should add another game to your Steam lib after you restart Steam, it will be Labeled INFRA, but with no thumbnail, nothing really works at the moment
note, the continue/new game button does not work, you must open the console and then type in (map mapname) map name is just a placeholder
there are also no servers made for this as I cannot for the life of me figure out networking, and I am having trouble getting the server browser to open
(ignore most of the stuff above, just download from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vScj5aCneH6uDSsV-lJSPL0kB5MI7wyu/view?usp=sharing and follow the READ.txt files directions
